# Python-Heart-Disease-Project
Heart Disease Analysis: This project uses NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualizing heart disease patterns.
The goal of this project is to analyze heart disease occurrence based on a combination of clinical features and demographic data.
- 45.87% of individuals in the dataset are diagnosed with heart disease.
- Elderly males (50–60 years) and females (55–65 years) are more commonly affected.
- Males are generally more prone to heart disease than females.
- Older age is a significant risk factor for heart disease.
- Asymptomatic chest pain is strongly associated with heart disease presence.
- Individuals with heart disease often show higher cholesterol levels.
- Blood pressure tends to rise between ages 50–70.
- Both cholesterol and max heart rate increase in the 50–60 age group.
- ST depression shows a notable increase in the 30–40 age group.
